                "To optimize the performance of the workload within the given storage budget, we need to carefully select indexes that will maximize the performance improvement while adhering to the constraints. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Index Set\nThe current index set is: [t2(c4); t6(c15); t6(c16)] with a total storage consumption of 224.3515625 MB.\n\n### Step 2: Identify High Overhead Predicates\nFrom the filter dictionary, we identify predicates with high overhead that are not already covered by the existing indexes:\n- **Hash Join**: \n  - `t6.c14 = t1.c1` (21)\n  - `t2.c5 = t7.c22` (21)\n  - `t7.c22 = t2.c5` (21)\n  - `t4.c26 = t5.c13` (19)\n  - `t2.c11 = t4.c27` (19)\n  - `t2.c11 = t3.c25 AND t2.c5 = t3.c24` (19)\n  - `t3.c24 = t7.c22` (17)\n- **Seq Scan**:\n  - `t2.c10 = ? AND t2.c9 = ? AND t2.c6 >= ?` (21)\n  - `t2.c8 >= ? AND t2.c8 < ?` (21)\n  - `t2.c3 < ?` (21)\n  - `t6.c15 >= ? AND t6.c15 < ?` (19)\n  - `t7.c23 >= ? AND t7.c19 = ? AND t7.c20 = ?` (18)\n- **Sort**:\n  - `t6.c18, t6.c15, t1.c2` (21)\n  - `t2.c4` (21)\n  - `t5.c12` (19)\n- **Group**:\n  - `t6.c18, t6.c15, t1.c2` (21)\n  - `t2.c4` (21)\n  - `t5.c12, t6.c15` (19)\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Potential Indexes\nWe need to evaluate potential indexes that can be added or extended to improve performance:\n\n1. **t2(c5)**: This column appears in multiple high-overhead predicates and is not currently indexed. Adding an index on `t2(c5)` would cost 149.52 MB.\n\n2. **t2(c11)**: This column is involved in a join predicate and could benefit from indexing. Adding an index on `t2(c11)` would cost 149.52 MB.\n\n3. **t6(c14)**: This column is involved in a join predicate and could benefit from indexing. Adding an index on `t6(c14)` would cost 37.38 MB.\n\n### Step 4: Select Indexes Within Budget\nThe current index set uses 224.3515625 MB. We have a budget of 500 MB, so we can add up to 275.6484375 MB of indexes.\n\n- Adding `t2(c5)` (149.52 MB) and `t6(c14)` (37.38 MB) would use 186.9 MB, bringing the total to 411.2515625 MB, which is within budget.\n\n### Step 5: Finalize the Index Set\nBased on the analysis, the final recommended index set is:\n\n**Final Recommended Index Set**: [t2(c4); t6(c15); t6(c16); t2(c5); t6(c14)]\n\nThis set maximizes the use of the storage budget while targeting high-overhead predicates to improve query performance.",
                "To optimize the performance of the workload within the given storage budget, we need to carefully select indexes that will maximize the performance improvement while adhering to the constraints.

Therefore, the remaining storage budget is:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ MB} - 224.3515625 \\text{ MB} = 275.6484375 \\text{ MB} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Identify High-Impact Columns for Indexing\nBased on the filter dictionary, we should focus on predicates with high overheads. The predicates with the highest overheads are:\n- `t6.c16 = t2.c4` (22)\n- `t2.c4 = t6.c16` (21)\n- `t6.c14 = t1.c1` (21)\n- `t2.c5 = t7.c22` (21)\n- `t7.c22 = t2.c5` (21)\n- `t2.c10 = ?

AND t2.c8 < ?` (21)\n- `t2.c3 < ?` (21)\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Potential Indexes\nWe need to consider the storage cost of potential indexes and ensure they fit within the remaining budget. Let's evaluate some potential indexes:\n\n1. **Index on `t2(c10)`**: \n   - Storage cost: 201.86 MB\n   - This index can help with the predicate `t2.c10 = ? AND t2.c9 = ? AND t2.c6 >= ?`.\n\n2. **Index on `t2(c9)`**:\n   - Storage cost: 314.01 MB\n   - This index is too large to fit within the remaining budget.\n\n3. **Index on `t2(c6)`**:\n   - Storage cost: 157.0 MB\n   - This index can help with the predicate `t2.c10 = ? AND t2.c9 = ? AND t2.c6 >= ?`.\n\n4. **Index on `t2(c8)`**:\n   - Storage cost: 149.52 MB\n   - This index can help with the predicate `t2.c8 >= ? AND t2.c8 < ?`.\n\n5. **Index on `t2(c3)`**:\n   - Storage cost: 149.52 MB\n   - This index can help with the predicate `t2.c3 < ?`.\n\n### Step 5: Select the Best Indexes\nGiven the remaining budget of 275.6484375 MB, we can select the following indexes:\n\n- **Add `t2(c10)`**: 201.86 MB\n- **Add `t2(c8)`**: 149.52 MB\n\nHowever, adding both `t2(c10)` and `t2(c8)` exceeds the budget. Therefore, we need to prioritize:\n\n- **Add `t2(c10)`**: 201.86 MB\n- **Add `t2(c3)`**: 149.52 MB\n\nThis combination exceeds the budget as well. Let's try:\n\n- **Add `t2(c6)`**: 157.0 MB\n- **Add `t2(c8)`**: 149.52 MB\n\nThis combination fits within the budget:\n\\[ 224.3515625 \\text{ MB} + 157.0 \\text{ MB} + 149.52 \\text{ MB} = 530.8715625 \\text{ MB} \\]\n\nThis combination also exceeds the budget. Let's try:\n\n- **Add `t2(c6)`**: 157.0 MB\n\nThis fits within the budget:\n\\[ 224.3515625 \\text{ MB} + 157.0 \\text{ MB} = 381.3515625 \\text{ MB} \\]\n\n### Final Recommended Index Set\n**Final Recommended Index Set**: [t2(c4); t6(c15); t6(c16); t2(c6)]\n\nThis set maximizes the use of the storage budget while providing significant performance improvements for the workload.",

We have a remaining budget of 500 MB - 224.3515625 MB = 275.6484375 MB.\n\n### Step 2: Identify High-Impact Predicates\nFrom the filter dictionary, we identify predicates with high overhead that are not already covered by the existing indexes or the bad indexes list:\n- **Hash Join**: \n  - t6.c14 = t1.c1 (21)\n  - t2.c5 = t7.c22 (21)\n  - t2.c11 = t4.c27 (19)\n  - t3.c24 = t7.c22 (17)\n- **Seq Scan**:\n  - t2.c10 = ?

Let's analyze the filter dictionary and the database structure to make informed decisions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Filter Dictionary\nThe filter dictionary provides overhead values for different operations. Higher overhead values indicate potential performance bottlenecks that can be alleviated by indexing. Let's focus on the operations with the highest overhead:\n\n- **Hash Join**: \n  - `t6.c16 = t2.c4`: 312\n  - `t2.c4 = t6.c16`: 112\n  - `t2.c5 = t7.c22`: 111\n  - `t7.c22 = t2.c5`: 109\n  - `t6.c14 = t1.c1`: 109\n  - `t4.c26 = t5.c13`: 91\n  - `t2.c11 = t4.c27`: 90\n  - `t2.c11 = t3.c25 AND t2.c5 = t3.c24`: 90\n  - `t3.c24 = t7.c22`: 75\n\n- **Seq Scan**:\n  - `c10 = ?

We have a storage budget of 500 MB, leaving us with approximately 275.6484375 MB available for additional indexes.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Potential Indexes\nBased on the filter dictionary and the database structure, we should consider indexes that address high overhead operations and fit within the storage budget:\n\n1. **t2(c11)**: Addresses `t2.c11 = t4.c27` and `t2.c11 = t3.c25 AND t2.c5 = t3.c24` with overheads of 90 each. Storage cost: 149.52 MB.\n2. **t6(c18)**: Addresses `t6.c18, t6.c15, t1.c2` with overhead of 112. Storage cost: 44.84 MB.\n3. **t2(c10)**: Addresses `c10 = ? AND c9 = ? AND c6 >= ?` with overhead of 111. Storage cost: 201.86 MB.\n\n### Step 4: Select Indexes Within Budget\nGiven the storage constraints, we need to select indexes that maximize performance improvement without exceeding the budget:\n\n- **Add t2(c11)**: This index addresses multiple high-overhead operations and fits within the budget. New storage consumption: 373.8715625 MB.\n- **Add t6(c18)**: This index addresses a high-overhead sort operation and fits within the remaining budget. New storage consumption: 418.7115625 MB.\n\n### Step 5: Finalize Index Set\nAfter evaluating the options and considering the storage budget, the final recommended index set is:\n\n**Final Recommended Index Set**: [t2(c4); t6(c15); t6(c16); t2(c11); t6(c18)]\n\nThis set optimizes the workload by addressing high-overhead operations while staying within the storage budget.",
                "To optimize the performance of the workload within the given storage budget, we need to carefully select indexes that will maximize the performance improvement while adhering to the constraints provided. Let's go through the process step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Index Set\nThe current index set is: `[t2(c4); t6(c15); t6(c16)]` with a storage consumption of 224.3515625 MB. We have a storage budget of 500 MB, so we have approximately 275.6484375 MB available for additional indexes.\n\n### Step 2: Identify High-Impact Predicates\nFrom the filter dictionary, we identify predicates with high overhead that are not already covered by the existing indexes or restricted indexes:\n- `t6.c16 = t2.c4`: Already covered by existing indexes.\n- `t2.c5 = t7.c22`: High overhead (111 + 109 = 220), but `t7(c22)` is a restricted index.\n- `t6.c14 = t1.c1`: High overhead (109), but `t6(c14)` is a restricted index.\n- `t4.c26 = t5.c13`: High overhead (91), but `t4(c26)` is a restricted index.\n- `t2.c11 = t4.c27`: High overhead (90).\n- `t2.c11 = t3.c25 AND t2.c5 = t3.c24`: High overhead (90), but `t3(c24)` is a restricted index.\n- `t3.c24 = t7.c22`: High overhead (75), but both `t3(c24)` and `t7(c22)` are restricted indexes.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Potential Indexes\nBased on the analysis, we consider the following potential indexes:\n1. **t2(c11)**: This index can help with the predicate `t2.c11 = t4.c27` and has a storage cost of 149.52 MB.\n2. **t2(c5)**: This index can help with the predicate `t2.c5 = t7.c22` and has a storage cost of 149.52 MB.\n\n### Step 4: Select Indexes Within Budget\nWe have approximately 275.6484375 MB available. We can add both `t2(c11)` and `t2(c5)` without exceeding the budget:\n- Adding `t2(c11)` (149.52 MB) and `t2(c5)` (149.52 MB) results in a total storage usage of 523.3915625 MB, which exceeds the budget. Therefore, we need to choose one.\n\n### Step 5: Finalize Index Selection\nGiven the constraints, we choose the index with the highest potential impact:\n- **Add `t2(c11)`**: This index addresses the predicate `t2.c11 = t4.c27` with a significant overhead of 90.\n\n### Final Recommended Index Set\nAfter adding `t2(c11)`, the final recommended index set is:\n**Final Recommended Index Set**: [t2(c4); t6(c15); t6(c16); t2(c11)]\n\nThis set maximizes the use of the storage budget while providing significant performance improvements for the workload.",
                "To optimize the performance of the workload within the given storage budget, we need to carefully analyze the filter dictionary and the database structure. Our goal is to maximize the use of the storage budget while ensuring that the indexes we choose will speed up the workload effectively. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Filter Dictionary\nThe filter dictionary provides overhead values for different operations. Higher overhead values indicate that the operation could benefit more from indexing. We should prioritize indexes that target these high-overhead operations.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Existing Index Set\nThe existing index set is: [t2(c4); t6(c15); t6(c16)], with a storage consumption of 224.3515625 MB. We have a remaining budget of 275.6484375 MB (500 MB - 224.3515625 MB).\n\n### Step 3: Identify Potential Indexes\nBased on the filter dictionary, we identify columns with high overhead values that are not already indexed or marked as bad indexes:\n- **Hash Join**: \n  - t2.c5 = t7.c22 (109)\n  - t6.c14 = t1.c1 (109)\n  - t2.c11 = t4.c27 (90)\n  - t3.c24 = t7.c22 (75)\n- **Seq Scan**:\n  - c10 = ? AND c9 = ? AND c6 >= ? (111)\n  - c8 >= ? AND c8 < ? (109)\n  - c3 < ? (108)\n- **Sort**:\n  - t6.c18, t6.c15, t1.c2 (112)\n  - t2.c4 (106)\n- **Group**:\n  - c17 (223)\n  - c4 (215)\n  - c12, c15 (182)\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Storage Costs\nWe need to ensure that the total storage cost of the selected indexes does not exceed the storage budget. Let's evaluate the storage costs of potential indexes:\n- t2(c5): 149.52 MB\n- t2(c11): 149.52 MB\n- t6(c18): 44.84 MB\n- t2(c10): 201.86 MB\n- t2(c9): 314.01 MB\n- t2(c3): 149.52 MB\n- t6(c14): 37.38 MB (marked as bad index)\n- t7(c22): 4.98 MB (marked as bad index)\n- t4(c27): 0.24 MB\n\n### Step 5: Select Optimal Indexes\nGiven the storage budget and the overhead values, we should prioritize indexes that provide significant performance improvements without exceeding the budget. We will avoid bad indexes and focus on the most beneficial ones.\n\n#### Recommended Index Set 1:\n- Add t2(c5) for Hash Join (109 overhead) and Seq Scan (c10 = ? AND c9 = ? AND c6 >= ?).\n- Add t2(c11) for Hash Join (90 overhead).\n- Add t6(c18) for Sort (112 overhead).\n\n**Recommended Index Set 1**: [t2(c4); t6(c15); t6(c16); t2(c5); t2(c11); t6(c18)]\n\n### Step 6: Check Storage Budget\nCalculate the total storage cost:\n- Existing indexes: 224.3515625 MB\n- New indexes: t2(c5) + t2(c11) + t6(c18) = 149.52 + 149.52 + 44.84 = 343.88 MB\n\nTotal storage cost: 224.3515625 MB + 343.88 MB = 568.2315625 MB\n\nSince this exceeds the budget, we need to adjust our selection.\n\n### Step 7: Adjust Index Selection\nRemove t2(c11) to fit within the budget.\n\n#### Final Recommended Index Set:\n- Add t2(c5) for Hash Join (109 overhead) and Seq Scan (c10 = ? AND c9 = ? AND c6 >= ?).\n- Add t6(c18) for Sort (112 overhead).\n\n**Final Recommended Index Set**: [t2(c4); t6(c15); t6(c16); t2(c5); t6(c18)]\n\nThis final set optimizes the workload within the storage budget, focusing on high-overhead operations and avoiding bad indexes."

AND t2.c8 < ?` (21), `t2.c3 < ?` (21)\n- **Sort**: `t6.c18, t6.c15, t1.c2` (21), `t6.c17` (21), `t2.c4` (21)\n- **Group**: `t6.c18, t6.c15, t1.c2` (21), `t6.c17` (21), `t2.c4` (21)\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Potential Indexes\nWe need to consider indexes that can reduce the overhead of these predicates and fit within the remaining storage budget (500 MB - 373.90625 MB = 126.09375 MB).\n\n#### Potential Indexes:\n1. **t2(c10)**: 201.86 MB (too large, cannot be added)\n2. **t2(c9)**: 314.01 MB (too large, cannot be added)\n3. **t2(c6)**: 157.0 MB (too large, cannot be added)\n4. **t2(c8)**: 149.52 MB (too large, cannot be added)\n5. **t2(c3)**: 149.52 MB (too large, cannot be added)\n6. **t6(c14)**: 37.38 MB (already marked as bad index)\n7. **t1(c1)**: 3.73 MB (can be added)\n8. **t5(c13)**: 0.01 MB (can be added)\n9. **t4(c27)**: 0.24 MB (can be added)\n10. **t3(c25)**: 19.93 MB (can be added)\n11. **t7(c19)**: 6.73 MB (can be added)\n12. **t7(c20)**: 6.73 MB (can be added)\n13. **t7(c21)**: 12.2 MB (can be added)\n\n### Step 4: Select Indexes to Add\nGiven the constraints, we will add indexes that can help reduce overhead and fit within the remaining budget:\n\n- **Add t1(c1)**: Helps with `t6.c14 = t1.c1` predicate. Storage cost: 3.73 MB.\n- **Add t5(c13)**: Helps with `t4.c26 = t5.c13` predicate. Storage cost: 0.01 MB.\n- **Add t4(c27)**: Helps with `t2.c11 = t4.c27` predicate. Storage cost: 0.24 MB.\n- **Add t3(c25)**: Helps with `t2.c11 = t3.c25 AND t2.c5 = t3.c24` predicate. Storage cost: 19.93 MB.\n- **Add t7(c19)**: Helps with `t7.c23 >= ? AND t7.c19 = ? AND t7.c20 = ?` predicate. Storage cost: 6.73 MB.\n- **Add t7(c20)**: Helps with `t7.c23 >= ? AND t7.c19 = ? AND t7.c20 = ?` predicate. Storage cost: 6.73 MB.\n- **Add t7(c21)**: Helps with `t7.c23 >= ? AND t7.c19 = ? AND t7.c20 = ?` predicate. Storage cost: 12.2 MB.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Total Storage Cost\nTotal storage cost of new indexes: 3.73 + 0.01 + 0.24 + 19.93 + 6.73 + 6.73 + 12.2 = 49.57 MB.\n\nTotal storage cost of all indexes: 373.90625 + 49.57 = 423.47625 MB, which is within the 500 MB budget.\n\n### Final Recommended Index Set\n**Final Recommended Index Set**: [t2(c4); t2(c5); t6(c15); t6(c16); t1(c1); t5(c13); t4(c27); t3(c25); t7(c19); t7(c20); t7(c21)]",

                "To optimize the given workload within the storage budget, we need to carefully select indexes that will improve query performance while adhering to the constraints. Let's analyze the given information and make recommendations step by step.\n\n### Initial Analysis\n1. **Current Index Set**: [t2(c4); t2(c5); t7(c19); t6(c15); t6(c16)]\n   - **Current Storage Consumption**: 380.6328125 MB\n   - **Remaining Storage Budget**: 500 MB - 380.6328125 MB = 119.3671875 MB\n\n2. **Filter Dictionary Analysis**:\n   - **Hash Join**: High overhead on predicates like `t6.c16 = t2.c4`, `t2.c4 = t6.c16`, `t6.c14 = t1.c1`, etc.\n   - **Seq Scan**: High overhead on predicates like `t2.c10 = ? AND t2.c9 = ? AND t2.c6 >= ?`, etc.\n   - **Sort and Group**: High overhead on columns like `t6.c18, t6.c15, t1.c2`, `t6.c17`, `t2.c4`, etc.\n\n3. **Potential Index Candidates**:\n   - Based on the filter dictionary, we should focus on columns involved in high overhead operations that are not already indexed or restricted.\n\n### Step-by-Step Index Recommendations\n\n#### Step 1: Evaluate Potential Indexes\n- **t2(c10)**: Involved in a high overhead Seq Scan predicate. Adding an index on `t2(c10)` could reduce the overhead.\n  - **Storage Cost**: 201.86 MB (exceeds remaining budget)\n\n- **t2(c9)**: Also involved in the same Seq Scan predicate as `t2(c10)`.\n  - **Storage Cost**: 314.01 MB (exceeds remaining budget)\n\n- **t2(c6)**: Involved in the same Seq Scan predicate as `t2(c10)` and `t2(c9)`.\n  - **Storage Cost**: 157.0 MB (exceeds remaining budget)\n\n- **t2(c11)**: Involved in a Hash Join predicate `t2.c11 = t4.c27`.\n  - **Storage Cost**: 149.52 MB (exceeds remaining budget)\n\n- **t7(c22)**: Involved in multiple Hash Join predicates, but restricted from use.\n\n#### Step 2: Optimize Within Budget\nGiven the constraints, we need to find a column that can be indexed within the remaining budget and provides a performance benefit.\n\n- **t2(c3)**: Involved in a Seq Scan predicate `t2.c3 < ?`.\n  - **Storage Cost**: 149.52 MB (exceeds remaining budget)\n\n- **t6(c14)**: Involved in a Hash Join predicate `t6.c14 = t1.c1`, but restricted from use.\n\n- **t3(c24)**: Involved in a Hash Join predicate `t2.c11 = t3.c25 AND t2.c5 = t3.c24`, but restricted from use.\n\n- **t7(c23)**: Involved in a Seq Scan predicate `t7.c23 >= ?

The current usage is 380.6328125 MB, leaving us with approximately 119.3671875 MB.\n\n### Step 4: Select New Indexes\n1. **Consider Adding t2(c10)**: \n   - This column is involved in a Seq Scan with high overhead. Adding an index on `t2(c10)` would cost 201.86 MB, which exceeds the remaining budget. Therefore, we cannot add this index.\n\n2. **Consider Adding t2(c9)**:\n   - This column is also involved in a Seq Scan. Adding an index on `t2(c9)` would cost 314.01 MB, which exceeds the remaining budget. Therefore, we cannot add this index.\n\n3. **Consider Adding t2(c6)**:\n   - This column is involved in a Seq Scan. Adding an index on `t2(c6)` would cost 157.0 MB, which exceeds the remaining budget. Therefore, we cannot add this index.\n\n4. **Consider Adding t2(c8)**:\n   - This column is involved in a Seq Scan. Adding an index on `t2(c8)` would cost 149.52 MB, which exceeds the remaining budget. Therefore, we cannot add this index.\n\n5. **Consider Adding t2(c3)**:\n   - This column is involved in a Seq Scan. Adding an index on `t2(c3)` would cost 149.52 MB, which exceeds the remaining budget. Therefore, we cannot add this index.\n\n6. **Consider Adding t7(c23)**:\n   - This column is involved in a Seq Scan. Adding an index on `t7(c23)` would cost 4.98 MB, which fits within the remaining budget. However, `t7(c23)` is listed as a bad index, so we cannot add it.\n\n7. **Consider Adding t2(c11)**:\n   - This column is involved in a Hash Join. Adding an index on `t2(c11)` would cost 149.52 MB, which exceeds the remaining budget. Therefore, we cannot add this index.\n\n### Step 5: Finalize Index Set\nGiven the constraints and the analysis, we find that no additional indexes can be added without exceeding the storage budget or violating the rules regarding bad indexes. Therefore, the final recommended index set remains unchanged:\n\n**Final Recommended Index Set**: `[t2(c4); t2(c5); t7(c19); t6(c15); t6(c16)]`\n\nThis set maximizes the use of the storage budget while adhering to the constraints provided.",

The storage cost is 149.52 MB, which exceeds our remaining budget.\n\n### Step 4: Optimize Within Budget\nGiven the constraints, we need to find a combination that fits within the remaining budget. Since none of the single-column indexes for `t2` fit within the remaining budget, we need to consider extending existing indexes.\n\n1. **Extend t2(c4) to t2(c4, c11)**: This extension could help with the predicate `t2.c11 = t4.c27`. The combined storage cost is 149.52 MB (c4) + 149.52 MB (c11) = 299.04 MB, which exceeds our remaining budget.\n\n2. **Extend t2(c5) to t2(c5, c11)**: This extension could help with the predicate `t2.c11 = t3.c25 AND t2.c5 = t3.c24`. The combined storage cost is 149.52 MB (c5) + 149.52 MB (c11) = 299.04 MB, which exceeds our remaining budget.\n\n### Step 5: Final Recommendation\nGiven the constraints and the inability to fit any additional indexes within the remaining budget, the best course of action is to maintain the current index set as it already provides significant coverage for the workload.\n\n**Final Recommended Index Set**: [t2(c4); t2(c5); t7(c19); t6(c15); t6(c16)]\n\nThis set maximizes the use of the available storage budget while adhering to the constraints and avoiding bad indexes.",
